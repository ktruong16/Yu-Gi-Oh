# Yu-Gi-Oh
This is my attempt at recreating the game Yu-Gi-Oh!

My game is based on the card game, Yu-Gi-Oh!, with my own twist to it.
The game begins with a set of random cards in the player's hand and field pattern with attack or defense.
Blue indicates defense, Red indicating attack.
The player decides to choose where to place the cards onto the field.
Once the field is completely filled, it will show the AI's field and proceed with damage calculations.
Whoever loses the most points, loses the game.
The game ends with a banner if you either a win, lose, or draw.
